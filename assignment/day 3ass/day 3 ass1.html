   <h1>MY SUCCESS</h1>
   <p>In 2012, Pakistan toured India for a bilateral series for the first time in five years. In the three-match ODI series, Dhoni top-scored for India in all three innings; however, India lost the series 1â€“2. In the first ODI at Chennai, he helped India recover from 29/5 to help post a total of 227 in 50 overs. Scoring 113 not out, he had a record partnership with Ravichandran Ashwin, although India had lost .[95]

Winning the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, Dhoni became the first and the only captain in international cricket to claim all ICC trophies. In the rain-shortened final against England, he was out for a duck and ended the tournament with 27 runs from two innings. However, Dhoni's field placements and tactics were to India's advantage, as the team had beat the opposition by five runs (D/L method).[96] He was also named as captain and wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC.[97]</p>
