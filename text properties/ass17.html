    <p>Thierry Delaporte, CEO and managing director of Wipro, said, “We have made significant investments in Wipro’s growth engine and are very pleased with the outcomes. Our order bookings grew 32 per cent YoY in Total Contract Value terms, powered by large transformational deals, and our pipeline today is at an all-time high.

        “We continue to reinforce the investments that allow us to grow our business, remain agile in the market and efficient as an organization, while staying focused on serving our clients even better," he further said.
        
        To address the high attrition rates, Wipro has planned to offer promotions to its employees every quarter, multiple reports have said recently. Wipro also plans to provide a salary hike of 10 per cent to most of its workforce in September, with the company’s top performers getting a salary hike of over 15 per cent. The Wipro salary hikes will be applicable up to the mid-management levels, the reports said.</p>
