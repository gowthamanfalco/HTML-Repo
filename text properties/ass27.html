    A sea is a large body of salty water. There are particular seas and the sea. The sea commonly refers to the
    ocean, the wider body of seawater. Particular seas are either marginal seas, second-order sections of the
    oceanic sea (e.g. the Mediterranean Sea), or certain large, nearly landlocked bodies of water.

    The salinity of water bodies varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large rivers and
    higher in the depths of the ocean; however, the relative proportions of dissolved salts vary little across the
    oceans. The most abundant solid dissolved in seawater is sodium chloride. The water also contains salts of
    magnesium, calcium, potassium, and mercury, amongst many other elements, some in minute concentrations.</p>

<p> The ocean moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles. The
    surface of water interacts with the atmosphere, exchanging properties such as particles and temperature, as well
    as currents. Surface currents are the water currents that are produced by the atmosphere's currents and its
    winds blowing over the surface of the water, producing wind waves, setting up through drag slow but stable
    circulations of water, as in the case of the ocean sustaining deep-sea ocean currents. Deep-sea currents, known
    together as the global conveyor belt, carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean and significantly
    influence Earth's climate. Tides, the generally twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels, are caused by Earth's
    rotation and the gravitational effects of the Moon and, to a lesser extent, of the Sun. Tides may have a very
    high range in bays or estuaries. Submarine earthquakes arising from tectonic plate movements under the oceans
    can lead to destructive tsunamis, as can volcanoes, huge landslides, or the impact of large meteorites.</p>

<p> wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, protists, algae, plants, fungi, and animals, lives in the seas,
    which offers a wide range of marine habitats and ecosystems, ranging vertically from the sunlit surface and
    shoreline to the great depths and pressures of the cold, dark abyssal zone, and in latitude from the cold waters
    under polar ice caps to the warm waters of coral reefs in tropical regions. Many of the major groups of
    organisms evolved in the sea and life may have started there.

    The seas have been an integral element for humans throughout history and culture. Humans harnessing and studying
    the seas have been recorded since ancient times, and evidenced well into prehistory, while its modern scientific
    study is called oceanography and maritime space is governed by the law of the sea, with admiralty law regulating
    human interactions at sea. The seas provide substantial supplies of food for humans, mainly fish, but also
    shellfish, mammals and seaweed, whether caught by fishermen or farmed underwater. Other human uses of the seas
    include trade, travel, mineral extraction, power generation, warfare, and leisure activities such as swimming,
    sailing, and scuba diving. Many of these activities create marine pollution.

    Definition
    Further information: List of seas

    Oceans and marginal seas as defined by the International Maritime Organization
    The sea is the interconnected system of all the Earth's oceanic waters, including the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian,
    Southern and Arctic Oceans.[1] However, the word "sea" can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies
    of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea. There is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans, though
    generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as marginal seas or particularly as a mediterranean sea) or
    wholly (as inland seas) enclosed by land.[2] However, an exception to this is the Sargasso Sea which has no
    coastline and lies within a circular current, the North Atlantic Gyre.[3]: 90  Seas are generally larger than
    lakes and contain salt water, but the Sea of Galilee is a freshwater lake.[4][a] The United Nations Convention
    on the Law of the Sea states that all of the ocean is "sea".[8][9][b]</p>

<p> definition
    The law of the sea has at its center the definition of the boundaries of the ocean, clarifying its application
    in marginal seas. But what bodies of water other than the sea the law applies to is being crucially negotiated
    in the case of the Caspian Sea and its status as "sea", basically revolving around the issue of the Caspian Sea
    about either being factually an oceanic sea or only a saline body of water and therefore solely a sea in the
    sense of the common use of the word, like all other saltwater lakes called sea.</p>

Earth is the only known planet with seas of liquid water on its surface,[3]: 22  although Mars possesses ice
caps and similar planets in other solar systems may have oceans.[11] Earth's 1,335,000,000 cubic kilometers
(320,000,000 cu mi) of sea contain about 97.2 percent of its known water[12][c] and cover approximately 71
percent of its surface.[3]: 7 [17] Another 2.15% of Earth's water is frozen, found in the sea ice covering the
Arctic Ocean, the ice cap covering Antarctica and its adjacent seas, and various glaciers and surface deposits
around the world. The remainder (about 0.65% of the whole) form underground reservoirs or various stages of the
water cycle, containing the freshwater encountered and used by most terrestrial life: vapor in the air, the
clouds it slowly forms, the rain falling from them, and the lakes and rivers spontaneously formed as its waters
flow again and again to the sea.[12]

The scientific study of water and Earth's water cycle is hydrology; hydrodynamics studies the physics of water
in motion. The more recent study of the sea in particular is oceanography. This began as the study of the shape
of the ocean's currents[18] but has since expanded into a large and multidisciplinary field:[19] it examines the
properties of seawater; studies waves, tides, and currents; charts coastlines and maps the seabeds; and studies
marine life.[20] The subfield dealing with the sea's motion, its forces, and the forces acting upon it is known
as physical oceanography.[21] Marine biology (biological oceanography) studies the plants, animals, and other
organisms inhabiting marine ecosystems. Both are informed by chemical oceanography, which studies the behavior
of elements and molecules within the oceans: particularly, at the moment, the ocean's role in the carbon cycle
and carbon dioxide's role in the increasing acidification of seawater. Marine and maritime geography charts the
shape and shaping of the sea, while marine geology (geological oceanography) has provided evidence of
continental drift and the composition and structure of the Earth, clarified the process of sedimentation, and
assisted the study of volcanism and earthquakes.[19]

Salinity
A characteristic of seawater is that it is salty. Salinity is usually measured in parts per thousand (‰ or per
mil), and the open ocean has about 35 grams (1.2 oz) solids per litre, a salinity of 35 ‰. The Mediterranean Sea
is slightly higher at 38 ‰,[22] while the salinity of the northern Red Sea can reach 41‰.[23] In contrast, some
landlocked hypersaline lakes have a much higher salinity, for example, the Dead Sea has 300 grams (11 oz)
dissolved solids per litre (300 ‰).

While the constituents of table salt (sodium and chloride) make up about 85 percent of the solids in solution,
there are also other metal ions such as magnesium and calcium, and negative ions including sulphate, carbonate,
and bromide. Despite variations in the levels of salinity in different seas, the relative composition of the
dissolved salts is stable throughout the world's oceans.[24][25] Seawater is too saline for humans to drink
safely, as the kidneys cannot excrete urine as salty as seawater.[26]
